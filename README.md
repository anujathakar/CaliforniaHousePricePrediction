# CaliforniaHousePricePrediction
This project demonstrates a basic regression task using the California housing dataset. The goal is to predict house prices based on features like number of rooms, population, and location-related attributes.

#Technologies & Libraries Used
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

#We use the California Housing Dataset from sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing(). It contains 20,640 samples with 8 numeric features such as:
Median income, Average number of rooms, Population, Latitude / Longitude

#Learning outcomes of this project:
How to apply linear regression to a real dataset

How to preprocess data and evaluate models

Understanding regression metrics like MSE

Visualization of predictions

#The outcome MSE (Mean Squared Error) shows the averaged squared distance between the actual and predicted house prices.
